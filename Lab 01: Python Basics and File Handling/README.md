# Lab 01: Python Basics and File Handling

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lab 01: Python Basics and File Handling**. This lab focuses on fundamental Python programming concepts, including functions, file handling (JSON and CSV), and basic data manipulation.

---

## Lab Overview

In this lab, I completed the following tasks:
1. **Factorial Calculation**: Wrote a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
2. **File Handling**:
   - Created, read, and appended data to **JSON** and **CSV** files.
   - Demonstrated how to manipulate data in these file formats.
3. **Jupyter Notebook Basics**: Documented the steps to open and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Factorial Calculation
- Implemented a Python function `calculate_fact(num)` to compute the factorial of a number.
- Example: `calculate_fact(4)` returns `24`.

### 2. File Handling
#### JSON Files:
- Created a JSON file (`items.json`) and wrote data to it.
- Read and printed the contents of the JSON file.
- Appended new data to an existing JSON file (`people_data.json`).

#### CSV Files:
- Created a CSV file (`General.csv`) and wrote data to it.
- Read and printed the contents of the CSV file.
- Appended new data to the CSV file.

### 3. Jupyter Notebook Basics
- Documented the steps to:
  - Install Jupyter Notebook.
  - Launch and create a new notebook.
  - Execute and save code in a notebook.

## Code and Implementation

The implementation of this lab is available in the Jupyter Notebook file:
- **Lab01.ipynb**

To run the notebook:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

**2. Navigate to the lab folder:**
Bash 
```
cd your-repo-name/Lab01
**Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

## Results and Observations
**Factorial Calculation:** The function works as expected, correctly computing factorials for given inputs.

**File Handling:** Successfully created, read, and appended data to JSON and CSV files.

**Jupyter Notebook:** The documented steps provide a clear guide for beginners to use Jupyter Notebook.
