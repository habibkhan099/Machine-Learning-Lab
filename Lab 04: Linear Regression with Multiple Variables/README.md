## üìå Introduction
In this lab, we focus on implementing **Simple Linear Regression** to predict target variables based on a single independent feature. Additionally, we evaluate the model's performance using statistical metrics like **R-squared**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Residual Plots**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Understand Linear Regression concepts
- Implement regression models using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluate model performance using key metrics
- Visualize regression results for better insights

---

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Avg. Area Income**: Average income of residents in the area
- **Avg. Area House Age**: Average age of houses
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**: Average number of rooms per house
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**: Average number of bedrooms per house
- **Area Population**: Population of the area
- **Price**: Target variable (House price)
- **Address**: Address of the property

## ‚ö° Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Loading
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("housing.csv")
data.head()
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Normalize/standardize features if needed

### 3. Model Training
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **R-squared** to measure model performance
- **Residual plots** for error analysis
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate prediction accuracy

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("R-squared:", r2_score(y_test, predictions))
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
```

## üìà Results & Visualizations
- **Regression Line Plot:** Shows the best-fit line against actual data points
- **Residual Plot:** Evaluates the distribution of prediction errors


---

## ‚ùì Lab Questions
1. What is the significance of the R-squared value in linear regression?
2. How do residual plots help in evaluating model performance?
3. What are the key assumptions of linear regression?
4. How can we improve the performance of our regression model?
